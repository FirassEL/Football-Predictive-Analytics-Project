# Football Player Market Value Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a predictive model that estimates the market value of football players. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the model analyzes various player attributes and historical data to provide accurate market value estimations. The insights gained from this project can assist clubs, agents, and analysts in making informed transfer decisions.

## Data Sources

The dataset includes key attributes of football players, such as:

Personal Information: Age, nationality, and playing position

Performance Metrics: Goals scored, assists, passing accuracy, and defensive contributions

Physical Attributes: Height, weight, and stamina

Club and League Factors: Team reputation, league competitiveness, and recent transfers

Market Factors: Historical transfer fees, demand trends, and contract duration

## Methodology

The project follows a structured approach:

Data Collection: Gathering and preprocessing relevant player data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, distributions, and correlations among variables.

Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful features to improve prediction accuracy.

Model Selection & Training: Evaluating various machine learning models, including:

- Linear Regression

- Decision Trees

- Random Forest

- Gradient Boosting Models (XGBoost, LightGBM)

- Neural Network

- Lasso and Ridge Regression

Model Evaluation: Using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (RÂ²) to assess performance.

Optimization & Fine-tuning: Hyperparameter tuning to enhance model efficiency.

## Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: RStudio

Libraries Used: tidyverse, caret, randomForest, xgboost, h2o, etc

Data Visualization: ggplot for graphical insights


Results & Insights

The model successfully predicts market values with a reasonable error margin, and comparing with other models by checking R^2 and MSE

Feature importance analysis highlights key factors influencing a player's market value.

The approach provides a data-driven strategy for football clubs to evaluate potential transfers.
